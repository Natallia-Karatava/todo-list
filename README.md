# To-Do List App - Learning Project

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, and it saves the tasks to a JSON file on the server. It provides basic functionality for managing tasks with a clean and minimalistic interface.

## Features

- **Add a new task:** Users can enter a new task and add it to the to-do list.

- **Mark task as completed:** Users can toggle the completion status of each task by clicking the checkbox.

- **Delete task:** Users can delete a task from the to-do list.

- **Persist tasks:** Tasks are saved to a JSON file on the server, ensuring that they persist between app reloads.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Hooks (useState, useEffect), and React Icons

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, and File System (for saving tasks in a JSON file)

- **Styling:** Custom CSS with a minimalistic approach

### Usage

- Add tasks by entering text into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.

- Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed or to toggle its completion status.

- Delete tasks by clicking the trash icon next to the task.
